                FEAT is the first on chain derivative of FTX’s bankruptcy assets, without risk of liquidation. The FEAT team had such a disgusting level of cope due to the FTX fraud, that they decided to come up with a way for the cryptoverse to lever up the value of their own bankruptcy assets. The FTX lawyers are making &gt; $2000/hr. The FTX CEO John Ray is making &gt; $1000 an hour. There’s only 1 way to fight this - by levering up!

                <p className="mb-4">
                FEAT’s mission is to increase the price of everyone’s bankruptcy assets by acquiring spot FTT & opening levered positions with proceeds from a 2% tax. Toxic leeches like John Ray, Kyle & Zhu, and FTX’s legal team are all seeking to drain user funds for their own gain. It’s time we created a vehicle for users to fight back.

So what are us copey wojacks supposed to do? [wojack screaming overlay]

We do the only thing we degens know how to do, make it all back in one trade [cinematic epic presentation for “make it back in one trade” ]

Enter, FTT Eater, aka $FEAT
<br />
The goal of FEAT, is to allow you to pump the value of your assets in bankruptcy court, so the same greedy hedge funds who caused this problem, aren’t <a className='text-blue-600' href="https://cryptopotato.com/su-zhu-and-kyle-davies-raising-25m-for-a-crypto-exchange-report/">gobbling up your assets for pennies on the dollar</a>. [insert su GTX article] Are you really going to let these guys run it back turbo?
<br />
The way it works, is for every FEAT purchased, a 2% buy and sell tax is 50% allocated to buying FTT spot, and 50% allocated to levering up FTT 5x.
<br />
And since 99% of FTT is going to be locked up in bankruptcy court for 10+ years (ie mt gox), it’s incredibly easy to pump this token. 
<br />
And we all know who else is incentivized to pump FTT as it’s biggest holder. [CZ silhouette]
<br />
As more FTT is eaten, fat hungry sam the caterpillar grows, along with the value of your assets. [show animation of gross fat caterpillar sam]

It’s time to fight for the future of this space, in the only way we know how. Levering up. [clip of anthony pomp arm mooning]
